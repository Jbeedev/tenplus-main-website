              arising out of or related hereto, will be governed exclusively by

              interpretation or enforcement. Each party hereby consents and
              submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. In any
              action or proceeding to enforce rights under the User Terms, the
              prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs

              provisions in these User Terms and any pages referenced in these
              User Terms, the terms of these User Terms will first prevail;
              provided, however, that if there is a conflict or inconsistency
              between the Contract and the User Terms, the terms of the Contract
              will first prevail, followed by the provisions in these User
              Terms, and then followed by the pages referenced in these User
              Terms (e.g., the Privacy Policy). Customer will be responsible for
              notifying Authorized Users of those conflicts or inconsistencies
              and until such time the terms set forth herein will be binding.
